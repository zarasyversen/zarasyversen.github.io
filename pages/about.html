           <p>I grew up in a very rural area called Svensh√∂jden in Sweden. It's a quite place, very few neighbours, no traffic and there is 30 minutes drive to the closest shop. I go back few times a year as my parents still live here.</p>
           <p>Before moving to Brighton in 2015, I lived and worked in Norway for 2 years. In 2012, I also spent 6 months in Richmond, Virginia as a part of an exchange at university.</p>
           <p>At university, I studied Visual Communication and Design. I always knew I wanted to work with something creative but I wasn't sure what that was. I used to play around with web design a bit in my spare time but didn't realise it was a profession.</p>
           <p>After 2 years in Norway, I wanted to move abroad again and came across a web design diploma course in Hove. I decided to go for it, moved to Brighton and this diploma ignited my passion for web development.</p>
           <p>The diploma lasted 6 months and during this time, I realised Brighton would be a great place to start my new career so I decided to stay here. I started to attend codebar, I spent a year building up skills and my portfolio. Then the magic happened - thanks to connections I made from codebar, I got offered a junior position at Gene!</p>
