      <p>I am a very happy front end developer at <a class="link" href="https://www.gene.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gene Commerce</a> in Brighton. I started working at Gene in June 2017 and it is my first job as a developer. We build and maintain e-commerce websites using the platform Magento.</p>
      <p>I am a co-organiser of <a class="link" href="https://www.codebar.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">codebar Brighton</a>. We organise workshops to help under-represented in tech learn how to code. I started as a student myself in 2016, then when I landed my first job I wanted to give back to this amazing community so I have been coaching and organising ever since.</p>
