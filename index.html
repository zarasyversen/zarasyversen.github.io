            <p>I'm a front end developer at <a class="link" href="https://www.gene.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gene Commerce</a> that is based in Brighton, UK. GENE specialises in the Adobe Magento Commerce platform, partnering with prominent brands (PayPal, Krispy Kreme, Tommee Tippee) to develop their e-commerce presence online. </p>
            <p>At Gene Commerce, I work on project builds from start to finish, working with planning and technical scoping, collaborating with designers, estimating & building features and ensuring the sites are fast & accessible. I'm also really passionate about team communication and fostering a positive and supportive work environment - I've won the GENE Awards twice as Little Miss Sunshine, most likely to brighten your day.</p>
            <p>In 2019, I got to fly to Las Vegas to attend Magento Imagine, a global e-commerce conference. We did the Big Dam Run (seen in picture above). I also became a certified Magento FE Developer that same year!</p>
            <p>I also enjoy learning outside of work, I recently built my own <a href="https://github.com/zarasyversen/PHP-Project" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PHP application</a> which was amazing fun and I learned tons! Routing was particurly challenging but <a href="https://twitter.com/madebyzara/status/1261958486344245248" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite exciting.</a> More information about the project in <a href="https://github.com/zarasyversen/PHP-Project#php-project---learning-project" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the readme</a>. I have now started building the FE application, learning the React framework Next.js!</p>

          <h2>How much I love a good community</h2>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>I started out as a codebar student myself in 2016, and thanks to the people I met along the way I was able to get a job in the industry. I love to give back to the community and my goal is to make every person I meet to be feel as supported and welcomed as I once was. As I started teaching and mentoring others, I realised how much I enjoy it - so it's really a win-win situation.</p>

              <p>In 2020, I was accepted and completed the Code First Girls Fellowship, a 2-month programme dedicated to developing the next generation of tech leaders through immersive teaching and coaching opportunities.</p>
              <p>As a part of this program, I taught an Introduction to Web Development class over 8 weeks, once a week. We were 3 instructors and I was lead instructor in 3 of the sessions, where I created lessons plan of material to cover, marked homework as well as motivated and supported the students outside of class hours. We covered topics from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks and GitHub to help the students build their own website at the end of the course!</p>
              <p>I was also an instructor for Introduction to Web Development in 2019 at Sussex University in Brighton.</p>

              <p>I started attending codebar after finishing my web design diploma in 2016. Every Tuesday evening for about 1 year, I would attend the workshops and meet new companies. One evening, codebar was hosted at <a class="link" href="https://www.gene.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gene</a> and I met one of their developers who introduced me to the boss - and I ended up with a junior position!</p>
              <p>After starting my job, I wanted to give back to this amazing community. I started coaching new beginners in HTML/CSS and then was asked to help organise the workshops as well. As an organiser, the responsibilites was to find companies to host/sponsor the weekly workshops, pair students with coaches and spread awareness in the Brighton tech community.</p>
              <p>I also helped students with job applications, creating connections and being their reference. My favourite thing about codebar was all the amazing people I met and the connections made, both professionally and personally!</p>
              <p>In 2019, I stopped volunteering as an codebar organiser to start being an instructor at CFG. I still return as a coach sometimes!</p>

We spent 12 hours at the Sussex Innovation Centre where we came up with ideas on how to bring more women in to STEM. We wrote a business model, built a prototype and pitched in front of judges at the end of the day.</p>
                <p>Through codebar, I have participated in many different workshops over my years in Brighton - ranging from subjects like three.js, git, canvas, CSS animation & building Android apps.</p>

                <p>I love meeting people in the community and I've been really lucky to attend some amazing events and listened to really inspiring people in the industry.</p>
                <p>In 2020 (pre-pandemic), I attended the <a class="link" href="https://womendrivendev.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women Driven Development Conference</a> at Sky UK Offices in London. If being in a room full of amazing women wasn't enough, all the speakers were brilliant and incredibly inspiring.</p>
                <p><a class="link" href="https://2019.ffconf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FFConf</a> has been one of my favourite conferences ever, that I attended in both 2018 and 2019. I'm going to be honest, I got incredibly starstruck when I saw <a class="link" href="http://tholman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Holman</a> speak there in 2018, and he made me laugh until I cried.</p>
                <p>A different type of conference I attended both 2017 and 2018 was <a class="link" href="https://medium.com/the-codelog/uncodebar-4-fb12fc542069" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncodebar</a>, hosted at Twitter in London. This was an unconference, where there were no talks planned and the attendees pitched sessions/talks they wanted the hold over the day. Great fun and really insightful!</p>
                <p>Some other events I really enjoyed are <a class="link" href="https://www.londoncss.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">London CSS</a>(2020), <a class="link" href="https://weareshesays.com/chapters/shesays-brighton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SheSays Brighton</a>(2017, 2018, 2019), <a class="link" href="https://patternsday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patterns Day</a>(2017, 2019), <a class="link" href="https://www.wespringforward.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WeSpringForward</a>(2017, 2018, 2019), <a class="link" href="https://www.ladiesthatux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ladies that UX</a> & <a class="link" href="https://asyncjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AsyncJS</a>.</p>

            <p>I grew up in a very rural area called SvenshÃ¶jden in Sweden. It's a very quiet and beautiful place, with few neighbours, almost no traffic and there is a 30 minutes drive to the closest shop. I love nature and animals, but have always been drawn to bigger things and new experiences.</p>
            <p>At Karlstad University, I studied Visual Communication and Design and I did an exchange semester in Richmond, Virginia, USA. After university, I moved to Norway and worked at Oslo Airport for 2 years as a check-in and boarding agent.</p>
            <p>I saved up money and wanted to go abroad again. I came across a web design diploma course in Brighton and just went for it. During this course, I realised that I had a passion for web development and I decided to stay in Brighton to pursue my new career.</p>
            <p>I found codebar in Brighton and became a part of this amazing community. For 1 year, I attended workshops and made connections, and fell more and more in love with the world of dev.</p>
            <p>Landed my first job at Gene Commerce thanks to the connections I made through codebar, and began my journey as a web developer! I returned to codebar as a coach and became a Brighton chapter organiser.</p>
            <p>As I started my job, I realised that I have finally found my dream job. At Gene Commerce, I have been able to grow a lot in just a few years, and I have continued to teach new developers via codebar and Code First Girls. </p>
            <p>After 4 years in Brighton, I was longing for something new. Due to the pandemic, I was able to make my role remote so I can work from anywhere. During 2020, I worked from Italy for a few weeks, and a few weeks from Spain but my base is now back home in Sweden.</p>
