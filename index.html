        <h2>How much I love a good community</h2>
        <div class="wrapper">
          <p>I started out as a codebar student myself in 2016, and thanks to the people I met along the way I was able to get a job in the industry. I love to give back to the community and my goal is to make every person I meet to be feel as supported and welcomed as I once was. As I started teaching and mentoring others, I realised how much I enjoy it - so it's really a win-win situation.</p>

            <p>In 2020, I was accepted and completed the Code First Girls Fellowship, a 2-month programme dedicated to developing the next generation of tech leaders through immersive teaching and coaching opportunities.</p>
            <p>As a part of this program, I taught a Introduction to Web Development class over 8 weeks, once a week. We were 3 instructors and I lead 3 classes on my own. We covered topics from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks and GitHub to help the students build their own website at the end of the course!</p>
            <p>I was also an instructor for Introduction to Web Development in 2019 at Sussex University in Brighton.</p>

            <h3>codebar - Organiser and coach</h3>
            <p><a class="link" href="https://codebar.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">codebar</a> is a UK charity that runs free, weekly workshops to help underrepresented learn coding in a safe and collaborative environment. </p>

              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>I started attending codebar after finishing my web design diploma in 2016. Every Tuesday evening for about 1 year, I would meet new companies and one day codebar was hosted at <a class="link" href="https://www.gene.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gene</a>, I met one of their developers who introduced me to the boss - and I ended up with a junior position!</p>
            <p>After starting my job, I wanted to give back to this amazing community. I started coaches new beginners in HTML/CSS and then was asked to help organise the workshops as well. As a organiser, the responsibilites was to find companies to host/sponsor the weekly workshops, pair students with coaches and spread awareness in the Brighton tech community.</p>
            <p>I also helped students with job applications, creating connections and being their reference. My favorite thing about codebar was all the amazing people I met and the connections made, both professionally and personally!</p>
            <p>In 2019, I stopped volunteering as an codebar organiser to start being an instructor at CFG. I still return as a coach sometimes :)</p>

          <p>I grew up in a very rural area called Svenshöjden in Sweden. It's a quiet place, very few neighbours, no traffic and there is 30 minutes drive to the closest shop. I go back few times a year as my parents still live here.</p>
          <p>At Karlstad University, I studied Visual Communication and Design. I always knew I wanted to work with something creative but I wasn't sure what that was. I used to play around with web design a bit in my spare time but didn't realise it was a profession.</p>
          <p>Before moving to Brighton in 2015, I lived and worked in Norway for 2 years. In 2012, I also spent 6 months in Richmond, Virginia as a part of an exchange at university.</p>
          <p>After 2 years in Norway, I wanted to move abroad again and came across a web design diploma course in Brighton. I decided to go for it, moved to Brighton and this diploma ignited my passion for web development.</p>
          <p>The diploma lasted 6 months and during this time, I realised Brighton would be a great place to start my new career. I started to attend codebar, I spent a year building up skills and my portfolio. Then the magic happened - thanks to connections I made from codebar, I got offered a junior position at Gene!</p>
